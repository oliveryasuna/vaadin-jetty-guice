This is an example of a Vaadin 23 servlet running in an embedded Jetty server with Guice as a dependency injection framework.

Check out my [Vaadin addons](https://vaadin.com/directory/?q=author%3AOliver_Yasuna).

## Why?

Honestly, I do not know...

Personally, I do not like the Jetty and Guice parts of this stack, but work with them professionally. 
I have seen it done many ways, and this is my take on it.
